"This implementation makes use of the MOTECH platform using an access pattern that is no longer supported.  (library mode)  While the artifacts this implementation depends on will remain new platform features and bugfixes will no longer be backported and therefore this implementation is considered to be using a fork of the main MOTECH code.  For information on how to migrate to a more recent version of MOTECH please contact the developers at motech-dev@googlegroups.com"
